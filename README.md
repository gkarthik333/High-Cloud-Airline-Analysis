# High-Cloud-Airline-Analysis
This project presents a multi-faceted analysis of airline data, covering key performance indicators, passenger preferences, flight patterns, and operational efficiency. The analysis is visualized through a series of interactive dashboards, providing insights into various aspects of the airline industry.

Data Sources (Implied):

Airline flight data (including scheduled and performed departures, distances, aircraft types)
Passenger data (including preferences, travel dates, and origin/destination information)
Geographical data (for origin/destination locations)

## Data Model
This project utilizes a star schema for optimal airline data analysis. The central 'Maindata_final' fact table integrates data from ten dimension tables, including Airlines, Aircraft Types, and Markets. This data model enhances analysis performance by efficiently organizing flight operations and related information.
